# Genome-wide exon capture uncovers host-microbiome co-diversification in Red Sea Sponges

Sponge microbiomes are diverse and likely coevolve with their hosts. Here we analyse the microbiome of a large sample of haplosclerid sponges from the Red Sea. We use whole-genome clade specific markers to infer a robust phylogeny of these sponges and understand the evolution of the haplosclerid holo-microbiome.

The following code is based on the *dada2* tutorial available at [https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html)
