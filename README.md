Sponge microbiomes are diverse and have been assumed to co-evolve with their hosts. Here we analyse the microbiome of a large sample of haplosclerid sponges from the Red Sea. We use whole-genome clade specific markers to infer a robust phylogeny of these sponges and understand the evolution of the haplosclerid holo-microbiome.

The following code is based on the *dada2* tutorial available at [https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html)

## Abstract

Understanding how microbiomes evolve in concert with their hosts is crucial for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of complex holobionts. Phylosymbiosis describes a pattern in which microbial community relationships parallel host phylogeny. Although often interpreted as evidence for host–microbiome co-diversification, phylosymbiosis can also arise from ecological filtering, a process in which hosts with similar physiology or morphological characteristics select for similar microbial communities regardless of host relatedness. Here, we test co-diversification against ecological filtering as alternative explanations for phylosymbiosis in marine sponges (Order Haplosclerida) from the Red Sea. We inferred a robust host phylogeny using 1,153 target-captured genome-wide loci from 144 specimens and characterised their prokaryotic microbiomes via V4 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Although host clade identity explained ~50% of microbial variation, topological analyses revealed high incongruence between host phylogeny and microbial community composition, and phylogenetic distance was only weakly correlated with microbiome dissimilarity. Partial Mantel tests confirmed geography did not affect this signal. Trait-based analyses using high versus low microbial abundance (HMA–LMA) classification, a key functional trait linked to sponge filtration physiology, revealed that this trait was a better predictor of microbiome composition than phylogenetic distance. Furthermore, phylogenetically distant clades with convergent HMA characteristics harboured similar microbiome profiles but had unique amplicon sequence variant (ASV) compositions, with between-trait dissimilarity exceeding within-trait dissimilarity. These findings indicate that sponge–microbiome associations are shaped by ecological filtering rather than by host–microbe co-diversification, and suggests that some sponge holobionts may be better understood as ecological consortia than as co-evolved units.
